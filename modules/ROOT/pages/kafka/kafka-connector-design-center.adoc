To configure a connector in Design Center:

. Configure the trigger for the connector, which can be an operation from this connector (if available), an HTTP Listener, or a Scheduler.
. Configure the target component for this connector.

== Configure the Trigger

. Click a trigger. You can create a global element by selecting this connector as they trigger.
If a global element is not needed, you can use an HTTP Listener or Scheduler trigger.
. To create an optional global element for the connector, set these fields:
.. Basic:
