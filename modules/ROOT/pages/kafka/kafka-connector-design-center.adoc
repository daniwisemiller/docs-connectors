Design Center enables you to create apps visually. To use Design Center, work with your Anypoint Platform administrator to ensure that you have a xref:access-management::environments.adoc#to-create-a-new-environment[Design environment]. For more information, see the xref:design-center::fd-tour.adoc[Flow Designer Tour].

To create an app in Design Center:

* Configure the input source (trigger) for your app.
* Add the connector as a component to process the input for the app.

For information on field values, see the xref:kafka/kafka-connector-reference.adoc[Connector Reference].

== Configure the Trigger

. In Design Center, click *Create*.
. Click *Create new application*.
. Specify a value for *Project name*.
. Exit from *Let's get started* by clicking *Go straight to canvas*.
. Click the name of the Ttrigger card.
. If you are using your connector as an input source trigger, search for the connector; otherwise, search for HTTP or Scheduler.
. Complete the fields with the values you want to configure for your trigger.  

To create an optional global element for the connector:

. Basic:
** Bootstap Servers - Comma-separated host-port pairs used for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster. This is the same as the bootstrap.servers value you must provide to Kafka clients (producer/consumer).
** Additional properties - Additional properties as key and value that you need for your connection. Here you can put whatever property Kafka supports.

** All the parameters from Basic configuration.
** Key Store Type - The file format of the key store file. This is optional and default value is "JKS".
** Key Store Password - The store password for the key store file. This is optional and only needed if "keyStoreLocation" is configured.
** Key Store Location - The location of the key store file. This is optional and can be used for two-way authentication for connector.

[NOTE]
To configure a Consumer (trigger) for all the configurations:
+
Consumer Partitions - The number of partitions to be used for the consumer. +
Group Id - A unique string that identifies the consumer group this consumer belongs to.

To add a component:

. Click “+” next to the trigger card.
. In *Select a component*, search for the connector name.
. Select the Kafka connector as the component.
+
Configure these fields:
+
. Consumer trigger:
** Topic - name of Kafka topic to consume messages from.
** Partition offsets(Optional) - list of Offset representing partitions offsets configuration. For each element in the list you have to specify partition index and offset.
+
