SAP Connector v4.1 and v4.2

The SAP connector enables the integration of data to and from SAP NetWeaver-based and external systems.

Note: This connector is only available in Mule 4 and Studio 7, and is not available in the Design Center feature of Anypoint Platform.

This connector requires a separate license. Contact MuleSoft to evaluate or use this connector in production.

Mule runtime supports SAP integration through our Anypoint Connector for SAP, an SAP-certified Java connector that leverages the SAP Java Connector (JCo) libraries, thus allowing Mule applications to:

* Execute BAPI functions over the RFC protocol, supporting the following types:
** Synchronous RFC (sRFC)
** Transactional RFC (tRFC)
** Queued RFC (qRFC)
* Act as a JCo Server to be called as a BAPI over sRFC, tRFC, and qRFC.
* Send IDocs over tRFC and qRFC.
* Receive IDocs over tRFC and qRFC.
* Transform SAP objects (JCo Function/BAPI & IDocs) to and from XML.

== About Connectors

Anypoint connectors are Mule runtime engine extensions that enable you to connect to APIs 
and resources on external systems, such as Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, and Twitter.

== Prerequisites

Before creating an app, you must have access to the SAP target resource and Anypoint Platform. You 
must also understand how to create a Mule app using Anypoint Studio.

This document assumes you have:

* A working knowledge of the SAP business context and in particular, the SAP R/3 Business Suite.
* A basic understanding of the SAP NetWeaver Platform from an administration point of view.
* Knowledge of the ABAP language.
* Login credentials to test your connection to your target resource.

For software requirements and compatibility information, see the 
xref:release-notes::connector/sap-connector-release-notes-mule-4.adoc[SAP Connector Release Notes].
