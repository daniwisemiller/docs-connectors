== Install Redis

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio task bar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange and supply your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. Search for the Redis connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

== Configure Redis

To use Redis connector in your Mule application, configure a global Redis element that can be used by all the connectors in the application.

The sections that follow provide the properties to configure the global element.

== Non-Cluster Configuration

In the image above, the placeholder values refer to a configuration file placed in the src folder of your project. You can either hardcode your credentials into the global configuration properties, or reference a configuration file that contains these values. For simpler maintenance and better re-usability of your project, Mule recommends that you use a configuration file. Keeping these values in a separate file is useful if you need to deploy to different environments, such as production, development, and QA, where your access credentials differ.
