== Install the Connector

. In Studio, click the Anypoint Exchange icon in the Studio task bar.
. In Exchange, click *Login* and supply your Anypoint Platform username and password.
. Search for the Redis connector, click on the connector in Exchange, and click *Add to project*.
. Follow the prompts.

== Configure the Connector

To use Redis connector in your Mule application, configure a global Redis element that can be used by all the connectors in the application.

The sections that follow provide the properties to configure the global element.

== Non-Cluster Configuration

In the image above, the placeholder values refer to a configuration file placed in the src folder of your project. You can either hardcode your credentials into the global configuration properties, or reference a configuration file that contains these values. For simpler maintenance and better re-usability of your project, Mule recommends that you use a configuration file. Keeping these values in a separate file is useful if you need to deploy to different environments, such as production, development, and QA, where your access credentials differ.

|Field |Description
|Name | Enter a name for this configuration to reference it later.
|Host| Redis host. Use this field when you want to access a Redis server that is not part of a cluster through the connector.
|Port| Redis port. The port on which your non-cluster server is running.
|Connection Timeout| Connection timeout in milliseconds.
|Entry Ttl| The default time to live to be set on keys stored through the connector.
|Password| Redis password. Set this in case that the server requires authentication.

== Configure an Input Source

Configure an input source for the connector such as a connector operation, using an *HTTP Listener*, or *Scheduler*.

Redis provides the *Subscribe* operation for use as an input source.

`<redis:subscribe>`
