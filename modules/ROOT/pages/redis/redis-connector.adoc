Redis Connector v5.1

Remote Dictionary Server (Redis) is an open source, in-memory data structure store that is used for use cases such as caching a user profile, creating a leader board, tracking real time activities on a website, implementing a spam filtering system, using it as a message queue, use as a custom object store, and more.

== About Connectors

Anypoint connectors are Mule runtime engine extensions that enable you to connect to APIs 
and resources on external systems, such as Salesforce, Redis, ServiceNow, and Twitter.
